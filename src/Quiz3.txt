1. [6] Write an algorithm using pseudo code to display if a given integer
number is a prime number. A prime number is a number that is divisible by
only 1 and by itself.

(Define Terms)
let number to be the number to be checked if it's prime.
let isPrime to be the boolean whether the number is prime.
let divisor to be the divisor.

START
divisor <- 2
number <- given number
isPrime <- True

Repeat while (divisor <= sqrt(number) {
    if number % divisor = 0 then
        isPrime <- False
        break the while loop
    divisor <- divisor + 1
}

Display isPrime
