    Question 1:
    [5] Write a Java method called reverse. This method takes as parameter a positive integer number,
    it then reverses the number and returns it as an integer number. For example if the input is 3854,
    the return value will be integer number 4583.

    Question 2:
    [10] A cipher is a method of sending secret messages by replacing each letter of
    the original text with a secret key. Write a java method called encipher that
    accepts a String of characters; it then enciphers and returns the String in another
    form based on the following substitution cipher key:
            ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
            VJMQDSBGKYAZPWETXCNLHORFUI
    Each letter character in the text is to be replaced by the corresponding letter in
    the cipher alphabet. For example if the give String is the following text:
          Attack at noon.
    The function will encipher and returns the following String:
          VLLVMA VL WEEW.

    Question 3:
    [5] What is the output of the following java program?
    public class Trace {
        public static void main (String!] args) {
                    char[] arr = {'A','B','C','D','E'};
                    String temp = "";
                    int i,j;
                    for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                        temp = "";
                        for (j = arr.length-1; j>i;j--)
                            temp += '-';
                        for (j = arr[i]; j>= arr[0]; j--)
                            temp += (char)j;
                        System.out.println(temp);
                    }
        }
    }
